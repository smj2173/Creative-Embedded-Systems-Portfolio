The goal of my design is to display a heat map on a computer that’s colors reflect if a user is getting closer to (“hotter ”) or further from (“colder”) the pre-determined target distance. I will pair my ESP32 to a distance sensor to achieve this and display the color gradient on my computer to give the game participant context clues if they are getting closer or further away from their target.
