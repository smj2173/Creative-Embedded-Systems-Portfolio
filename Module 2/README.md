<b>Module 2: Interactive Devices</b>

This module intends to create an interactive device with the provided hardware. The devices will run off wired power and send data back to your laptop for visualization, sonfication, or whatever media generation process you prefer.

In this module, I connected a button to the ESP32 with wiring using a breadboard to connect all components. I then created an enclosure for the device to hide the hardware details. I wrote an ESP32 program that collects sensor data from the button attached to the breadboard and sends it over a serial connection to my laptop. I then wrote a media generation program on my laptop to handle this data.
