This project was completed using an ESP32 TTGO T-display with the end-goal of creating a generative art installation.

The project intended to make use of batteries to be hooked up to the ESP32 so that the ESP32 could run continously and wirelessly for as long as the battery life permitted, but due to obstacles encountered with the safety of the batteries, the installation was continued using a hardware platform that could hold 10 to 12 ESP32s at once.

The project can be broken down into two parts: the technical and the creative. I will elaborate on the technical steps required to carry out this installation here.

To create the generative art on the ESP32, we had to implement code that would create the particular design we wanted to carry out using Arduino. 

Arduino allowed me to customize when and how colors might change in the generative art, how to display certain texts, and how to ensure that the generative art had the appropriate dimensions and functionalities to be run on an ESP32 in particular rather than some other display device.

In order to get the code I implemented on Arduino my MacBook Air laptop to the ESP32, I connected my ESP32 to my computer using an USB-C cable on both ends. I was then able to compile and upload the code so that would it would run on the ESP32 device. This was an important part of the testing process of my creative vision in assessing how the code I was writing manifested on a visual interface.

Once the code with the graphics I desired to display on my ESP32 was compiled and uploaded onto my device, the only step remaining was to plug the ESP32 into the hardware board in the installation and then my code and therefore generative art would run and be visible to others in the class as part of the class-wide installation!
